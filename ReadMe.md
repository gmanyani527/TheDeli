# 🥪 DELIcious - Sandwich POS Ordering System

## 📌 Project Description

**DELIcious** is a Java console-based Point of Sale (POS) application for a custom sandwich shop. It enables customers to fully customize their orders with sandwiches, drinks, and chips, and receive itemized receipts. Built using object-oriented principles, the project simulates a real-world restaurant workflow and features advanced components like signature sandwiches, dynamic pricing based on size and extras, and file-based receipt management.
