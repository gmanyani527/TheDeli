# DELIcious Point-of-Sale Ordering System

## üìå Description of the Project

The **DELIcious Point-of-Sale System** is a Java console-based application designed for a growing custom sandwich shop. Customers can fully customize their sandwich orders by selecting bread types, sandwich sizes, toppings (regular and premium), and optional extras like drinks and chips. This system replaces the manual paper-based process and simulates a real-world deli ordering experience.

The application emphasizes **object-oriented programming**, **menu-driven user interfaces**, **file I/O**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **realistic pricing logic**. Orders are saved with time-stamped receipts in a dedicated folder.
